## 🌟 What is C++ Space Colony?

**C++ Space Colony** is a **practical, hands-on course** where you learn **modern C++** by solving survival challenges in a simulated space colony. Each "mission" introduces key concepts (from loops to multithreading) and challenges you to implement working solutions.

### 🎮 Learning by Doing
Instead of boring lectures, you'll:
- **Code real applications** that simulate colony systems
- **Face realistic problems** like oxygen leaks, energy shortages, and meteor threats
- **Build progressively** from basic variables to advanced OOP and file I/O
- **Get immediate feedback** through running simulations

### 🌍 Bilingual Support
All content available in **English** and **Spanish** for global accessibility.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
✅ Master **C++17/20** with real-world examples  
✅ Understand **STL, design patterns, and concurrency**  
✅ Build a **GitHub portfolio** with functional code  
✅ Join an **active learning community**  

---

## 📋 Prerequisites
- **Basic programming knowledge** (any language)
- **C++ compiler** (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- **CMake** (3.10+ for builds)
- **Git** for version control
- **Text editor** (VS Code recommended)

*No prior C++ experience required!*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TresDtres/Aprende-C-Moderno-Jugando.git
cd Aprende-C-Moderno-Jugando
```

### 2. Build All Missions
```bash
cd missions
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

### 3. Start Learning
```bash
cd mission-01-oxygen
cd build
./oxygen_solution
```

### 4. Follow the Missions
1. Read the `README.md` for the story and objectives
2. Complete the `base.cpp` skeleton
3. Compare with `solution.cpp`
4. Reflect with `reflection.md`
5. Try `bonus.cpp` for extra challenges

# 🚀 MISSION 7: CONTROL CENTER
**Module:** System Integration  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)  
**Key Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism, file I/O.

---

## 📖 NARRATIVE
> 🖥️ **FINAL INTEGRATION**  
> The colony's control center must integrate all previous systems: communication, maintenance, inventory, sensors.  
> Use inheritance to create a base System class, polymorphism for different system types.  
> Save and load system states from files using std::filesystem.  
> **Your mission:** Build the ultimate control center to manage the entire colony.

## 🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
✅ Understand inheritance and base/derived classes.  
✅ Implement polymorphism with virtual functions.  
✅ Use file I/O for persistence.  
✅ Integrate multiple systems into one cohesive program.  
✅ Apply std::filesystem for modern file handling.  
✅ **NEW:** Learn internationalization (i18n) best practices.  
✅ Implement language selection and text localization.

## 💻 CODE BASE
The base.cpp file contains an incomplete skeleton. Complete the TODOs to implement the control center.

---

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT
**"System Integrator"** - Successfully integrate all colony systems.

---

## 📋 INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a base System class with virtual functions.
2. Derive specific system classes (Communication, Maintenance, etc.).
3. Implement file save/load for system states.
4. Use polymorphism to manage systems uniformly.
5. Output integrated status reports.

Run the program to test system integration.

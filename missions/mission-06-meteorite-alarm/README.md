# 🚀 MISSION 6: METEORITE ALARM
**Module:** Sensor Systems  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Concepts:** Classes, encapsulation, member functions.

---

## 📖 NARRATIVE
> ☄️ **METEORITE THREAT**  
> Incoming meteorites detected! The colony's sensor system must monitor, detect, and alert for threats.  
> Design a Sensor class to track meteorite positions, velocities, and threat levels.  
> Implement encapsulation to protect sensor data and provide safe access.  
> **Your mission:** Build a reliable alarm system to protect the colony.

## 🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
✅ Understand classes and objects in C++.  
✅ Implement encapsulation with private members and public methods.  
✅ Use constructors and destructors.  
✅ Create member functions for data manipulation.  
✅ Apply const correctness for safety.

---

## 💻 CODE BASE
The base.cpp file contains an incomplete skeleton. Complete the TODOs to implement the Sensor class.

---

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT
**"Sensor Specialist"** - Successfully implement the meteorite detection system.

---

## 📋 INSTRUCTIONS
1. Define a Meteorite class with position, velocity, threat level.
2. Create a Sensor class to manage meteorites.
3. Implement add, remove, scan functions.
4. Use encapsulation to protect data.
5. Output alerts for high-threat meteorites.

Run the program with sample meteorites to test.

## 📖 NARRATIVE
> 📦 **RESOURCE CRISIS**  
> Supplies are running low in the colony! You must manage the inventory of food, water, and tools using advanced containers.  
> Add, remove, and consume resources efficiently. Filter low-stock items and prioritize restocking.  
> **Your mission:** Keep the colony supplied using modern C++ collection features.

## 🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
✅ Master std::vector for dynamic collections.  
✅ Use iterators for traversal and modification.  
✅ Apply C++20 ranges for filtering and transformation.  
✅ Implement lambdas for custom operations.  
✅ Handle resource management with std::optional for errors.

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT
**"Resource Manager"** - Successfully manage inventory and prevent shortages.

---

## 📋 INSTRUCTIONS
1. Define a Resource struct with name, quantity, threshold.
2. Use std::vector to store resources.
3. Implement add, remove, consume functions with iterators.
4. Use C++20 ranges to filter low-stock items.
5. Output inventory status.

Run the program with sample operations to test.

# 🚀 MISSION 3: COMMUNICATION DECODING
**Module:** Communication Systems  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆ (Easy)  
**Key Concepts:** std::string, getline, string search, input handling.

---

## 📖 NARRATIVE
> 📡 **COMMUNICATION FAILURE**  
> A distress signal has been received from a nearby outpost, but it's encrypted!  
> The message is hidden in a stream of text, and you need to decode it by finding specific keywords and reconstructing the message.  
> Use string operations to search for clues and extract the vital information.  
> **Your mission:** Decode the message before time runs out!

## 🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
✅ Understand std::string and its operations.  
✅ Use getline for reading input lines.  
✅ Implement string search and manipulation.  
✅ Handle user input and process text data.  
✅ Apply modern C++ features like auto for type deduction.

---

## 💻 CODE BASE
The base.cpp file contains an incomplete skeleton. Complete the TODOs to implement the decoding logic.

---

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT
**"Decoder"** - Successfully decode the hidden message and save the outpost.

---

## 📋 INSTRUCTIONS
1. Read the input text using getline.
2. Search for specific keywords in the text.
3. Extract and reconstruct the decoded message.
4. Output the decoded message.

Run the program with sample input to test.

# Reflection: Mission 3 - Communication Decoding

## Questions for Reflection
1. **Why is std::string preferred over char arrays for text processing?** Consider memory management and ease of use.
2. **How does std::getline differ from std::cin >> for reading input?** When would you use one over the other?
3. **What are the advantages of using find() for string search?** How does it compare to manual loops?
4. **How did using auto improve the code readability?** Provide an example from the solution.
5. **In a real-world scenario, how could this decoding logic be extended for more complex patterns?** Think about security or data parsing.

## Key Takeaways
- Strings are fundamental for handling text in C++.
- Input handling requires careful consideration of line-based vs. token-based reading.
- Modern C++ features like auto reduce verbosity and improve maintainability.
- Searching and manipulating strings efficiently is key for communication systems.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with different keywords or input formats.
- Try implementing the bonus regex version and compare performance.

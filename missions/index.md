## 📋 How to Use
1. Start with Mission 01.
2. Read the README.md for narrative and objectives.
3. Complete the base.cpp skeleton.
4. Compare with solution.cpp.
5. Reflect with reflection.md.
6. Try bonus.cpp for advanced challenges.

## 🛠️ Building and Running
Each mission has a CMakeLists.txt for portable builds.
```bash
cd mission-XX-topic
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./executable
```

## 📖 Philosophy
Inspired by [PHILOSOPHY.md](mission-01-oxygen/PHILOSOPHY.md) - Learn by failing, thinking like an engineer.

# Reflection: Mission 4 - Robot Maintenance

## Questions for Reflection
1. **Why use structs instead of separate variables for sector data?** Consider organization and scalability.
2. **How do nested loops help in processing 2D data?** Compare to single loops.
3. **What are the benefits of std::vector over raw arrays?** Think about safety and flexibility.
4. **How does random initialization simulate real-world unpredictability?** How could this be improved?
5. **In maintenance systems, why is prioritization (e.g., damage > 50) important?** Relate to resource allocation.

## Key Takeaways
- Structs group data logically for complex objects.
- Nested loops are essential for grid-based operations.
- Vectors provide dynamic, safe collections.
- State management (repaired flag) is key for simulations.

## Next Steps
- Modify the repair threshold and observe changes.
- Add more fields to the struct, like location or type.

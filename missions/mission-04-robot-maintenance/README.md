# 🚀 MISSION 4: ROBOT MAINTENANCE
**Module:** Maintenance Systems  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐☆ (Intermediate)  
**Key Concepts:** structs, arrays/vectors, nested loops.

---

## 📖 NARRATIVE
> 🤖 **ROBOT MALFUNCTION**  
> The maintenance robots in the colony are failing! Sectors of the habitat need repair, but the robots can only handle one sector at a time.  
> You must map the damaged sectors, prioritize repairs, and ensure all critical areas are fixed before the colony collapses.  
> **Your mission:** Use data structures to organize sector data and automate the repair process.

## 🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
✅ Understand structs for grouping related data.  
✅ Use arrays and std::vector for collections.  
✅ Implement nested loops for multi-dimensional processing.  
✅ Apply logic for prioritization and state management.  
✅ Practice debugging with structured data.

---

## 💻 CODE BASE
The base.cpp file contains an incomplete skeleton. Complete the TODOs to implement the sector mapping and repair logic.

---

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT
**"Maintenance Master"** - Successfully repair all damaged sectors and stabilize the colony.

---

## 📋 INSTRUCTIONS
1. Define a struct for sector data (e.g., damage level, priority).
2. Create an array or vector of sectors.
3. Use nested loops to scan and repair sectors.
4. Output the repair status for each sector.

Run the program with sample data to test.
